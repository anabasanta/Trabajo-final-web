			<p class="paragraphthebeaner">Ana is the creator of our new, fun and playful line of headphones. She worked as secretary in a famous printmaking company and found herself lost in the sounds of the machines. Watching a print in the process the idea merged with the necessity and it was born. She left everything she had built so far -which wasn't much because she was only 16- and started her life in the right place all over again. She designed a different kind of headphones that didnt fall in the boring mold it was built at the time. Now she has an empire and beaners are seen walking and dancing to the beat of music all over the world</p>

			<h2 class="thebeanerh2"> And the first Beaner was born</h2>
			<p class="paragraphthebeaner">The night Ana got to her new home in Argentina she was bombarded with new ways of seing the world. Thus she found herself looking for the best materials and crew to make her dream come to live. She went all over town in Buenos Aires and as she got to a library tired of looking at the same materials she tried to relax. Thats where she realized she was the one who had to do it or nobody was going to do it for her. And that's how the first Beaner was born, in 2016 and the idea was pitched perfectly. A true dream come true story</p>
